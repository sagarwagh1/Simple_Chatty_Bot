Let's take your skill of converting miles to kilometers to the next level! Define a function that accepts the number of miles and returns this distance in kilometers.
Assume that one mile is approximately equal to 1.609 kilometers.
You don't have to handle input, just implement the function.
Sample Input:
100
Sample Output:
160.9
